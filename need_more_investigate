need more investigate

1. other request
    1. install_snapshot_request
        complicated one
        currently we disable stream and let flying request finish
    2. custom_notification_request
        it is just a reminder, we disable stream and let flying request finish
3. how to deal with error
    1. socket and resp error
        reset socket and reset rpc and reset stream
    2. resp not accepted
        just disable stream, and let flying request finish
    3. stale rpc for sent
        for sent() callback, does it need to be protected by rpc protector to avoid to add read callback after rpc is reseted
4. flag
    1. append_log_flag
    2. allowed_append_log_flag
    3. write_flag
    4. streaming_mode_flag
